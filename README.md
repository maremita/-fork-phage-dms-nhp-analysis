## Abstract
Macaques are a commonly used model for studying immunity to human viruses, including for studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. However, it is unknown whether macaque antibody responses recapitulate, and thus appropriately model, the response in humans. To answer this question, we employed a phage-based deep mutational scanning approach (Phage-DMS) to compare which linear epitopes are targeted on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in humans and macaques following either vaccination or infection. We also used Phage-DMS to determine antibody escape pathways within each epitope, enabling a granular comparison of antibody binding specificities at the locus level. Overall, we identified some common epitope targets in both macaques and humans, including in the fusion peptide (FP) and stem helix-heptad repeat 2 (SH-H) regions. Differences between groups included a response to epitopes in the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) in vaccinated humans but not vaccinated macaques, as well as recognition of a CTD epitope and epitopes flanking the FP in convalescent macaques but not convalescent humans. There was also considerable variability in the escape pathways among individuals within each group. Sera from convalescent macaques showed the least variability in escape overall and converged on a common response with vaccinated humans in the SH-H epitope region, suggesting highly similar antibodies were elicited. Collectively, these findings suggest that the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in macaques shares many features with humans, but with substantial differences in the recognition of certain epitopes and considerable individual variability in antibody escape profiles, suggesting a diverse repertoire of antibodies that can respond to major epitopes in both humans and macaques.

## What is this?
This repository contains all of the data and code needed to recreate the analyses presented in the manuscript, "Macaque-human differences in SARS-CoV-2 Spike antibody response elicited by vaccination or infection."

## What is contained in each directory?

    code/
contains code to analyze the data and reproduce the figures in the manuscript. Most of the figures are generated by the R script, `phage_dms_nhp_plotting_code_SPIKE2.Rmd`. Plots related to escape profile comparisons are generated using [`python`](https://www.python.org/) via a few [`jupyter`](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks.

    data/
contains the data files in CSV format for input to the plotting and analysis scripts in the `code` directory.

    figures/
contains figure files, named as in the manuscript. See manuscript for figure legends. SPIKE1 and SPIKE2 are duplicate phage libraries, generated by independently cloning the oligo sequences into the phage vector, then amplifying the phage. Manuscript figures and analysis were performed using the SPIKE2 phage library. We also include versions of all figures made using data from the SPIKE1 library.

### Running the R script
The `.Rmd` file is intended to be run in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). We have used `RStudio 1.3.1093`.

### Running the `jupyter` notebooks
The `python` code depends on the [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/), [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [`xarray`](https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/), [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/), [Biopython](https://biopython.org/), [Python Optimal Transport](https://pythonot.github.io/), and [`jupyter`](https://jupyter.org/) packages. We have used `python 3.6.12`.

We provide a [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/) environment file to install the needed packages (and any other dependencies). For example, cloning this repository and setting up the environment can be done as follows:
	
    git clone https://github.com/matsengrp/phage-dms-nhp-analysis
    cd code
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate nhp-dms
    
The notebooks `plot_escape_compare_sims.ipynb` and `plot_sum_diff_sel.ipynb` reproduced Figs. 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 5A, 5B (for both SPIKE1 and SPIKE2 phage libraries).
