## What is this?
This repository contains all of the data and code needed to recreate the analyses presented in the manuscript, "[manuscript title]".

## What is contained in each directory?

    code/
contains an .Rmd file with code to plot all figures except Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5A and 5B.
~~ description of a .py file from Kevin goes here? ~~

    data/
contains the data files required to run phage_dms_nhp_plotting_code_SPIKE2.Rmd
~~ description of input data files for Kevin's analysis? ~~

    figures/
contains figure files, named as in the manuscript. See manuscript for figure legends. SPIKE1 and SPIKE2 are duplicate phage libraries, generated by independently cloning the oligo sequences into the phage vector, then amplifying the phage. Manuscript figures and analysis were performed using the SPIKE2 phage library. We also include versions of all figures made using data from the SPIKE1 library.
